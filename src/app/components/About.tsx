            My name is Sanket Jambhulkar, and I am a budding software engineer with a deep passion for technology and innovation. Currently, I am pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science at G.H. Raisoni College of Engineering in Nagpur, maintaining an impressive 8.3 CGPA. My academic journey has been driven by a keen interest in programming languages such as Java, C, C++, and JavaScript, alongside practical experience with development frameworks like React.js, Node.js, and Express.js. My goal is to leverage these skills in a Software Engineer position at Google, where I can contribute to cutting-edge projects in distributed systems, machine learning, and information retrieval.

            During my time as a Software Intern at Infobyte in Nagpur, I honed my technical and collaborative skills by working on various projects, including developing a personal portfolio, landing page, and calculators using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This role allowed me to demonstrate my ability to work effectively in a team, solve complex problems, and deliver high-quality results under tight deadlines. I have also developed several personal projects, such as Wanderlust, a user-friendly platform for booking unique stays in India, and Jadoo, an AI-driven hotel management system. These projects have equipped me with hands-on experience in using modern technologies and frameworks.

            Outside of academics and internships, I actively participate in extra-curricular activities, such as the GDSC events at my college, and have achieved a global rank of 8340 in the Leetcode weekly contest 386. These experiences have not only sharpened my technical skills but also nurtured my adaptability, resilience, and strong communication abilities. As a proactive and empathetic individual, I thrive in challenging environments and am always eager to embrace new adventures in the tech world.
